% Workday summary of my MITRE job:
% I developed several end-to-end data pipelines for government sponsors, as a contractor. I worked on big data streams, using SQL and Python to analyze numerical, text, and image data and process it for analysis. I have also processed downstream data by leveraging AI/ML using Python to provide high quality, data-driven insights to these government sponsors.

% Why do you want to work at PostEra?
% I am interested in and excited by leveraging AI and data science to advance health care and patient outcomes. I have a limited ability to do this at my current job, and I am looking to take the next step in my career. I am passionate about data ML and data science, and I believe that I can best use my talents at PostEra to bring good into the world.
% (more generic) I am interested in and excited by leveraging AI and data science to solve hard problems. I have a limited ability to do this at my current job, and I am looking to take the next step in my career. I am passionate about data ML and data science, and I believe that I can best use my talents at <COMPANY> to bring good into the world.

% What drew your interest to this position at Rumble?
% I believe in many of the core tenets of Rumble, that the internet is one of the last havens of free speech and needs to be protected. My resume will show that I have the technical qualifications for this position, with my 11 years of experience in Python and my several publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals, among others. However, what drew me to this position was the unique mission of Rumble to amplify under-emphasized voices.

% What makes you a good fit for this role? (I copied some text from the job desc)
% I have several years of experience developing modern data science solutions using complex, messy medical data. I have worked on teams to query large databases of raw health data and developed robust database search algorithms to ease this process. I also have some front-end experience as well, leveraging Flask to create a web dashboard visualizing the risk and impact of COVID-19 in the US at a county level. Overall, I am an experienced software engineer with experience performing both front-end and back-end data operations.

% Why do you want to be an AI Engineer at Pocket Prep?
% I’m excited about the AI Engineer role at Pocket Prep because it aligns with my passion for making education more equitable and accessible. High-pressure exams can be gatekeepers to meaningful career advancement, and I’m drawn to Pocket Prep’s mission of lowering those barriers. I want to contribute to building AI-driven solutions that don’t just "flash", but contribute meaningful impact to real people.
% My technical experience is well-documented in my resume, and I want to specifically highlight a project I worked on that implemented a RAG architecture. I was responsible for leading the entire development, from ideating the initial solution, to deploying it in AWS and engaging with the client for feedback. I believe my experience with end-to-end ML projects and the "soft skills" (secretly some of the most important) I demonstrated here are what set me apart from other candidates.
