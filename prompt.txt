Restructure the following technical experience section of a resume to better match the job description below. 
Preserve LaTeX formatting. Only return the updated technical experience section. Include no other extra formatting in your response.

Include three sections in your output: employment, notable projects, and notable programming expertise.

Include at least 8 bullet points in the "Employment" section.

Choose up to 3 projects to highlight in the "Notable Projects" section. Include at least 6 bullet points for each project, but
you may include more. Do not include the same number for all projects. You may use the commented-out projects in addition
to the un-commented projects, depending on which ones best match the job description. List the projects in order of 
most recent to least recent.

Keep the format of the "Notable programming expertise" section the same, with a subsection for programming languages
and one for other notable software. Keep each line of "notable software" under 70 characters before introducing a line break
